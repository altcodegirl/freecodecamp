<!--An element's margin controls the amount of space between an element's border and surrounding elements.
If you set an element's margin to a negative value, the element will grow larger.
Try to set the margin to a negative value like the one for the red box.
Change the margin of the green box to -15px, so it fills the entire horizontal width of the yellow box around it.-->
