<!--HTML has a special element for creating ordered lists, or numbered-style lists.
Ordered lists start with a <ol> element. Then they contain some number of <li> elements.
For example:
  <ol>
    <li>Garfield</li>
    <li>Sylvester</li>
  </ol>
would create a numbered list of "Garfield" and "Sylvester".
Create an ordered list of the top 3 things cats hate the most.-->
