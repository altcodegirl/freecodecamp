<style>
  .red-text {

<h2 class="red-text">CatPhotoApp</h2>

<p class="red-text">Kitty ipsum dolor sit amet, shed everywhere shed everywhere 
  stretching attack your ankles chase the red dot, hairball run catnip eat the grass sniff.</p>

<!--Remember that you can attach classes to HTML elements by using class="your-class-here" within the relevant element's opening tag.
Remember that CSS class selectors require a period at the beginning like this:
  .blue-text {
    color: blue;
  }
But also remember that class declarations don't use a period, like this:
  <h2 class="blue-text">CatPhotoApp</h2>-->
