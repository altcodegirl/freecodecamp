Radio buttons are a type of input
Each of your radio buttons should be nested within its own label element.
All related radio buttons should have the same name attribute.
Here's an example of a radio button:
  <label><input type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor"> Indoor</label>
Add a pair of radio buttons to your form. One should have the option of indoor and the other should have the option of outdoor.-->
