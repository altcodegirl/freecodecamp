<!--CSS has a property called width that controls an element's width. Just like with fonts, we'll use px (pixels) to specify the image's width.
For example, if we wanted to create a CSS class called larger-image that gave HTML elements a width of 500 pixels, we'd use:
  <style>
    .larger-image {
      width: 500px;
    }
</style>
Create a class called smaller-image and use it to resize the image so that it's only 100 pixels wide.-->
