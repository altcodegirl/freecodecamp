<!--Now, let's import and apply a Google font (note that if Google is blocked in your country, you will need to skip this challenge).
First, you'll need to make a call to Google to grab the Lobster font and load it into your HTML.
Copy the following code snippet and paste it into the top of your code editor:

<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Lobster" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">

Now you can set Lobster as a font-family value on your h2 element.-->
