<!--Your cat photo currently has sharp corners. We can round out those corners with a CSS property called border-radius.
You can specify a border-radius with pixels. Give your cat photo a border-radius of 10px.
Note: this waypoint allows for multiple possible solutions. 
For example, you may add border-radius to either the .thick-green-border class or .smaller-image class.-->
