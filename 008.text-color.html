<!--Now let's change the color of some of our text.
We can do this by changing the style of your h2 element.
The style that is responsible for the color of an element's text is the "color" style.
Here's how you would set your h2 element's text color to blue:
<h2 style="color: blue">CatPhotoApp</h2>
Change your h2 element's style so that its text color is red.-->

<h2 style="color:red">CatPhotoApp</h2>

<p>Kitty ipsum dolor sit amet, shed everywhere shed everywhere stretching attack your ankles chase the red dot, hairball run catnip eat the grass sniff.</p>
