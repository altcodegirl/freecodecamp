<!--CSS borders have properties like style, color and width
For example, if we wanted to create a red, 5 pixel border around an HTML element, we could use this class:
  <style>
    .thin-red-border {
      border-color: red;
      border-width: 5px;
      border-style: solid;
    }
  </style>
Create a class called thick-green-border that puts a 10-pixel-wide green border with a style 
of solid around an HTML element, and apply that class to your cat photo.
Remember that you can apply multiple classes to an element by separating each class with a 
space within its class attribute. For example: <img class="class1 class2">-->
