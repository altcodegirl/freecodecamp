<!--You can build web forms that actually submit data to a server using nothing more than pure HTML. 
You can do this by specifying an action on your form element.
For example:
  <form action="/url-where-you-want-to-submit-form-data"></form>
Nest your text field in a form element. Add the action="/submit-cat-photo" attribute to this form element.-->
