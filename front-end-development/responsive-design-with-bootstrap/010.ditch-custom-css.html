<!--We can clean up our code and make our Cat Photo App look more conventional by using Bootstrap's built-in styles instead of the custom styles we created earlier.
Don't worry - there will be plenty of time to customize our CSS later.
Delete the .red-text, p, and .smaller-image CSS declarations from your style element so that the only declarations left in your style element are h2 and thick-green-border.
Then delete the p element that contains a dead link. Then remove the red-text class from your h2 element and replace it with the text-primary Bootstrap class.
Finally, remove the "smaller-image" class from your first img element and replace it with the img-responsive class.-->
